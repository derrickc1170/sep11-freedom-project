#### Progress
I watched this video to understand GDevelop:  
[Beginner’s Guide To GDevelop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=595-swNh0Mw)

- I added a **player character object** to my project.  
- I added a **Top-down movement behavior** to the player so it can move around with arrow keys or WASD.

- I created **wall objects** to act as boundaries.  
- I learned how to **add a collision event** so the player cannot go through walls.

- I used **“Collision → Player collides with Wall”**.  
- I set the action to *move the player back or stop movement* to prevent passing through walls.

#### Challenges
- The menu in GDevelop was **confusing at first**, making it hard to find the correct actions and options, like **adding to a variable** or updating the **Text object**.

#### Next Steps
- Next time, I would try to **add lighting effects** to the game to create a more horror/atmospheric feeling.

#### Progress

I watched this video to learn how to create lighting effects in GDevelop:
[How To Use The Light Object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaeOsm1TKiM&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- I added a player character object to test lighting interactions.

- I experimented with a light source that makes the screen turn dark when the player gets near it.

- I learned how to use Lighting layers and Light objects to create a simple effect.

#### Challenges

- Figuring out how to trigger the darkness based on player position.

- Understanding GDevelop’s Lighting system and setting up proper Light objects.

#### Next Steps

- Next, I want to add more interactive light sources that the player can move near or turn on/off.

- Experiment with dynamic and flickering light to create a scarier atmosphere.

Combine sound effects with lighting changes to enhance the horror experience.
