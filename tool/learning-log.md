I watched this video to understand GDevelop:
[Beginner’s Guide To GDevelop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=595-swNh0Mw)

- I added a **player character object** to my project.

- I added a **Top-down movement behavior** to the player so it can move around with arrow keys or WASD.

- I created **wall objects** to act as boundaries.
- I learned how to **add a collision event** so the player cannot go through walls.

- I used **“Collision → Player collides with Wall”**.
- I set the action to **move the player back or stop movement** to prevent passing through walls.
