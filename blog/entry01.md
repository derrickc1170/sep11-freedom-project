* Content:
The tool I decided to use is GDevelop. I chose GDevelop because I think it’s easier to use for making my game.
I started tinkering with GDevelop by making a small test game where if the player goes out of bounds, then they can respawn back to the same position. You can find more details about this project in my Learning Log.[Learning Log](https://github.com/derrickc1170/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/tool/learning-log.md)
* EDP (Engineering Design Process):
I followed the steps of the Engineering Design Process by first identifying a problem (how to make a working game), then researching how to use GDevelop. I planned my game idea, created a prototype, and tested different features like player movement and respawn behavior to improve it.
* Skill:
I applied creativity, critical thinking, and technical skills in designing my horror game. I also practiced problem-solving when fixing a lot of bugs and learning how to control the behavior of a player in GDevelop while testing.
