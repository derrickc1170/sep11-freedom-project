### Content:
* The tool I decided to use for my freedom project is GDevelop. The reason why I chose GDevelop because I think it’s easier to use for making my game which it is a Horror game.
* I started tinkering with GDevelop by making a small test game where if the player goes out of bounds, then they can respawn back to the  same position. You can find more details about this project in my Learning Log.
* During the testing of the game, I experimented with the different movement behaviors, collision events, and how objects in the scene interact with each other.
* I have played around with the game interface, placing walls and boundaries in order to make the game environment feel more realistic and challenging.
* Soon I might tried adding small interactive elements to make the gameplay more engaging and to understand how GDevelop use  player interactions.

### EDP (Engineering Design Process):
* Currently, I am at the testing and prototyping stage of the engineering design process. In GDevelop, I've created a small test game where the player, upon moving out of bounds, respawns in the same position. The next stage in the engineering design process will be to add features that make the game more fun, such as the score system or other interactive elements.

### Skill:
#### Problem Solving
* I make that the player respawned same place each time they went out of bounds presented difficulties for me. In order to fix these problems, I tested various scenarios, looked at GDevelop tutorials, and played around with events and conditions until the wall functioned consistently.

#### Creativity
* I use my creativity to determine how the player should be able to not go through the wall, so there is no error.To determine what felt best for gameplay, I experimented with different movement settings and collision events to make sure the player’s controls worked reliably without bugs.
