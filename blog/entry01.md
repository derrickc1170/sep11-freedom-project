The tool I decided to use is GDevelop. I chose GDevelop because I think it’s easier to use for making my game.
I started tinkering with GDevelop by making a small test game where, if the player goes out of bounds, they respawn back to the same position. You can find more details about this project in my Learning Log.[Learning Log](https://github.com/derrickc1170/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/tool/learning-log.md)
